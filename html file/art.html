                <p class="card-text">This the expression or application of human creative skill and imagination, typically in a visual form such as painting or sculpture, producing works to be appreciated primarily for their beauty or emotional power.</p>
                <h5 class="card-title">Origin of art</h5>
                <p class="card-text">Seventeen thousand years ago, humans painted realistic images of bulls, bison, stags, horses, and other animals on the walls of the caves of Lascaux, in France. They made stencils of their hands, too. There's lots of cave art in Europe, but there is also prehistoric cave art in Indonesia.</p>
                <h5 class="card-title">Element of Art</h5>
                <p class="card-text">The seven most common elements include line, shape, texture, form, space, colour and value, with the additions of mark making, and materiality. When analyzing these intentionally utilized elements, the viewer is guided towards a deeper understanding of the work.</p>

            Autoplay next videoThe art of losing isn't hard to master;
            so many things seem filled with the intent
            to be lost that their loss is no disaster,<br><br>
            
            Lose something every day. Accept the fluster
            of lost door keys, the hour badly spent.
            The art of losing isn't hard to master.<br><br>
            
            Then practice losing farther, losing faster:
            places, and names, and where it was you meant
            to travel. None of these will bring disaster.<br><br>
            
            I lost my mother's watch. And look! my last, or
            next-to-last, of three loved houses went.
            The art of losing isn't hard to master.<br><br>
            
            I lost two cities, lovely ones. And, vaster,
            some realms I owned, two rivers, a continent.
            I miss them, but it wasn't a disaster.<br><br>
            
            - Even losing you (the joking voice, a gesture
            I love) I shan't have lied. It's evident
            the art of losing's not too hard to master
            though it may look like (Write it!) like disaster.</p>
